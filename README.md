# GoApi122

With the introduction of enhanced routing patterns in Go 1.22, thereâ€™s no longer a need to use the external mux package.

## Mux Patterns

Ref: https://pkg.go.dev/net/http@master#hdr-Patterns-ServeMux

In general, a pattern looks like `[METHOD ][HOST]/[PATH]`

Some examples:

- `/index.html` matches the path "/index.html" for any host and method.
- `GET /static/` matches a GET request whose path begins with "/static/".
- `example.com/` matches any request to the host "example.com".
- `example.com/{$}` matches requests with host "example.com" and path "/".
- `/b/{bucket}/o/{objectname...}` matches paths whose first segment is "b" and whose third segment is "o". The name "bucket" - denotes the second segment and "objectname" denotes the remainder of the path.

Note that:

- A pattern with no method matches every method.
- A pattern with the method GET matches both GET and HEAD requests.
- Otherwise, the method must match exactly.
- A pattern with no host matches every host.
